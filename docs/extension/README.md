# Extending Creo

Creo's design focuses on the extensibility of the framework.
This document describes the various ways in which Creo can be extended.

The simplest way to extend Creo, is to add new handler functions to an already
supported programming language. The guide explaining how to add new handler functions
can be found [here](./handler_functions.md).

As a next step, contributors may integrate a new framework to an already supported
programming language. The guide on how to add a new web framework can be found
[here](./frameworks.md).

Finally, we encourage all contributors to also implement the support for
additional programming languages. The guide detailing the process of adding a new
programming language to Creo can be found [here](./programming_language.md).
